Cars are fascinating. Not only are they advanced pieces of machinery that get us from point A to point B at the push of a pedal, but they make for great metaphors. So much so that I wrote my college essay about how passion is like the engine to a car. In order to get far you'll need to have strong passion for what you do. However, this post is about **momentum** not __passion__.

p = (m)(v)

If you took physics in highschool you may remember that equation. It's simple. Momentum = Mass * Velocity. In the workplace I equate __mass__ to **amount of work** and __velocity__ to how fast you do it. In order to maximize your momentum you have to find equilbirum in how much work you can do in thr fastest amount of t.
